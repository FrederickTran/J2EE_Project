                        <p>Privacy and Copyright Protection</p><br>

                        Rhythms X’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Rhythms X can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.<br>

                        We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.<br>

                        We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Rhythms X’s policy about responding to notices in our Help Center.<br>

                        <p>Your Content in our Services</p><br>

                        Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.<br>

                        When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Rhythms X (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Rhythms X Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.<br>

                        Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.<br>

                        If you have a Rhythms X Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Rhythms X or on third-party applications connected to your Rhythms X Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Rhythms X Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.<br>

                        You can find more information about how Rhythms X uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.<br>

                        <p>About Software in our Services</p><br>

                        When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.<br>

                        Rhythms X gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Rhythms X as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Rhythms X, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.<br>

                        Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.<br>
